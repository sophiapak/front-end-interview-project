## Future Improvements + Stretch Implementations

As prompted, I didn't want to spend an inordinate amount of time but there are quite a few things if I had more time would love to have implemented:

- Flush out the Testing Suite with more variety of tests (eg. Integration + End to End)
- Smoothing the Small Hiccup Alignment in the wrapping of products when the Application Page transitions between the targeted mobile and desktop comps
- Trying to update the overall page to be more accessibility-friendly (Current Google Lighthouse Accessibility Rating: 89/100)
- Optimizing the Product Images so it doesn't bottleneck the initial response time
